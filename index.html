    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a data analyst with a background in telecommunications and technical operations, 
        specializing in transforming raw data into actionable business insights. My experience 
        leading operational teams has shaped my ability to approach analytics with a business-first mindset, 
        focusing on measurable impact and strategic decision-making.
    </p>
    <p>
        I work primarily with SQL, Python, and Tableau to perform data cleaning, exploratory analysis, 
        predictive modeling, and dashboard development. I am particularly interested in customer behavior 
        analytics, operational efficiency, and data-driven process improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am passionate about leveraging data to uncover patterns, reduce risk, and support 
        smarter business decisions.
